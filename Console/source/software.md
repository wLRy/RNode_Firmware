## Software
This RNode contains a repository of downloadable software and utilities, that are useful for bootstrapping communications networks, and for replicating RNodes.

**Please Note!** Whenever you install software onto your computer, there is a risk that someone modified this software to include malicious code. Be extra careful installing anything from this RNode, if you did not get it from a source you trust, or if there is a risk it was modified in transit.

If possible, you can check that the `SHA-256` hashes of any downloaded files correspond to the list of release hashes published on the [Reticulum Release page](https://github.com/markqvist/Reticulum/releases).

**You Have The Source!** Due to the size limitations of shipping all this software within an RNode, we don't include separate source-code archives for the below programs, but *all the source code is included within the Python .whl files*!

You can simply unzip any of them with any program that understands `zip` files, and you will find the source code inside the unzipped directory (for some zip programs, you may need to change the file ending to `.zip`).

You can also download the copy of the [RNode Firmware source-code]({ASSET_PATH}pkg/rnode_firmware.zip) that is stored in this RNode.
