## Spread Knowledge and Awareness
Another great way to contribute, is to spread awareness about the RNode project. Here's some ideas:

- Introduce the concepts of Free & Open Communications Systems to your community
- Teach others to build and use RNodes, and how to set up resilient and private communications systems
- Learn about using Reticulum to set up resilient communications networks, and teach these skills to people in your area that need them

## Contribute Code & Material
If you like to write, build and design, there are plenty of oppertunities to take part in the community around RNode, and the wider Reticulum community as well.

There's always plenty of work to do, from writing code, tutorials and guides, to designing parts, devices and integrations, and translating material to other languages.

You can find us the following places:
